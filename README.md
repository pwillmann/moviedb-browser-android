This project is based on Kotlin, MvRx, Epoxy, Koin and ReactiveX. MvRx's sample app was used as a project
starter template to kickstart development.

## Setup

In order to run the app a TMDB Api Token is required.
The token must be put in either the project root levels `gradle.properties` or the `gradle.properties`
of the system wide `.gradle` folder.
